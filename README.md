Git and GitHub
=======

The course was amazing! I’ve systematized my existing knowledge and learned a few new things, such as cherry-pick,  creating PR and solving the conflicts if they occur. Also I’ve finally understood git flow process. Now i feel much more comfortable with Git and GitHub.  

Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools
=======

Codecademy course about CLI was extremely useful for we.  I have learnt a lot of new commands ( for example,  redirection commands ) Also i’ve learnt how to configure the environment in bash profile using nano editor. And I would definitely use them im my daily routine.

Speaking about 2 articles about HTTP: it was new for me to learn about connection handling,  authentication and caching. Also i didn’t know about the tool called Chrome/Webkit inspector.  I would definitely use it in the future. I hope i will deepen my knowledge while having a real practise with HTTP and learning more about it.
